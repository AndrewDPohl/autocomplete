# jQuery Autocomplete

## An autocomplete that utilizes jQuery but without any specific autocomplete plugins.  

## Technologies used: jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap

## TODOS:
* Still working out how to allow for a pure case insensitive search (i.e., at this point you have to use capital letters to find a word that begins with a capital letter).  I am already using the ignorecase modifier on the regex call
* Ideally I would like to be able to highlight the section of the search result string based on the input string
* Would like to add a delete function for the individual items in the results section
